# OxfordMH - Oxford Medical Handbooks
The Oxford Medical Handbooks are the market leading series of pocket handbooks, written for a broad medical readership, from students, junior doctors and specialist trainees, to nurses, dentists, paramedics, and allied health professionals.

The series began with the publication in 1985 of the beloved Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine. Starting life as handwritten notes to help the authors get through their junior doctor years, it is now the world's best-selling medical handbook. Since then the series has grown to around 50 books, covering medical specialties from paediatrics to geriatric medicine, and more. Titles fall into two broad categories; those for medical students and junior doctors, and those for specialist trainees.
